# Core dependencies
torch>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0
thrml  # Thermal/EBM experimentation (Extropic)

# Optional dependencies for training and experiments
datasets>=2.0.0  # For language modeling datasets
transformers>=4.20.0  # For tokenizers
pytest>=7.0.0  # For running tests

# CRV (Circuit-based Reasoning Verification) dependencies
scipy>=1.11.0  # For clustering and graph analysis (Phase 1+)

# Note: spare_parts is expected to be in the parent directory
# This is a companion package from the QRI-1 repository that provides:
# - Delay dynamics (spare_parts.dynamics.delay)
# - Telemetry (spare_parts.telemetry)
# - PID controllers (spare_parts.controllers.pid_autopilot)
# - CDNS metrics (spare_parts.metrics.cdns_torch)
# - Kernel registry (spare_parts.kernels.registry)
#
# To get spare_parts:
# 1. Clone https://github.com/QualiaResearchInstitute/QRI-1 to the parent directory
# 2. Ensure spare_parts/ is available at the same level as resonance-transformer/
#
# See README.md for detailed setup instructions
